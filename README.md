# avr_os
A simple task manager for 8-bit AVR microcontrollers.

## Legal
Currently all of this code os GPLv2. There are no copyright headers
at the moment. If you really want to use this for something let me 
know and I will sort all of that out.

## Purpose
This OS provides several OS type services for embedded development
on 8-bit AVR microcontrollers.

This was my final project for my Graduate Embedded Development class 
(ECE533) at BSU. I don't have any plans to develop it further, but
I can be convinced if there is actual interest.

## Use
This was developed for the Atmega 324 using Atmel Studio 6.1. Atmel Studio
may have changed since this was developed, so your milage may vary.

## Features
* Cooperative Multitasking support
* Syncronization primatives - Mutexes
* Device Support
  * ADC
  * Timers
  * GPIO
  * Serial IO and SPI
